\section{Conclusions and further work}

This report has been a summary of work done to categorise and fully understand the entangled photon emitting QDs.

Chapter 3 was concerned with understanding the time evolution of the polarisation entanglement. Using the time gating theory a dramatic rise in the entanglement fidelity was achieved. This theory is important both for understanding the underlying dynamics of the biexciton-exciton entangled cascade and also as a technique to achieve higher fidelity in a regime where time discrimination is possible. There may also be use cases in time-dependent quantum logic, where the phase of the entangled state may be chosen.

Chapter 4 presented a detailed study on the excitonic pattern observed in the QDs which have a high propensity for entangled photon emission. A theoretical model was developed and was seen to have good agreement with the measurements. Further work has been done in this area by the group since the end of this project. It has been seen that the second excitonic patterns seen on the sample are likely to be negatively charged. This implies that the entangled photon emission from the second pattern may only be practically useless, because the exciton intensity is so low. This negative charging has the ability to be tuned by adding a second excitation wavelength (around 1 $\mu m$) which allowed gradual tuning of the QD from positive to negative. This tuning has the potential to greatly increase the density of entangled photon emitters.

Further work would include investigating the QDs under resonant excitation, where the exciton and biexciton states are populated directly. With this neutral excitation the quality of the spectrum and the entanglement may improve. The group is also now focusing on different tuning strategies for the QDs. QDs integrated on piezoelectric crystals can be tuned through strain has been shown by the group to alter the wavelength through a free meV. The FSS has been shown to be tunable by a vertical electric field \cite{verfield}.
