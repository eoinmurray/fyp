\section{Results}

## Time resolved entanglement.

### Introduction and theory.

Introduction to the thesis of Toshiba, talk about time resolved entanglement.

### Experimental data.

- Correlation curves - showing the anti-phase intensity of g2 is orthogonal bases.
- Fidelity vs gate start time.
- Fidelity vs gate width with constant start time.

The emitted photon pair from a typical quantum dot with a degenerate exciton level has a polarization entanglement expressed by the Bell state

$$\ \left|\psi\right\rangle = \left|L_xR_{xx}\right\rangle + \left|R_xL_{xx}\right\rangle$$

This can be expressed also as

$$\ \left|\psi\right\rangle = \left|H_xH_{xx}\right\rangle + \left|V_xV_{xx}\right\rangle$$

or

$$\ \left|\psi\right\rangle = \left|D_xD_{xx}\right\rangle + \left|A_xA_{xx}\right\rangle$$

with L(R) – circularly left (right) hand, H(V) – horizontally (vertically), D(A) – diagonally (antidiagonally) polarized photons.
With xx being the biexciton and x the exciton.

An ideal source of polarization entangled photons should display a perfect correlation measured in a linear and diagonal bases and a perfect anticorrelation in a circular basis.

In Fig. 3 polarization-resolved second-order correlation functions are simulated in the linear, diagonal and circlular bases.
In Fig. 3, the perfect case, we see absolute bunching in linear and diagonal basis and absolute antibunching in the circular basis.

## Time tagging single photon emission.

Single photon g2 with and without time gating.
