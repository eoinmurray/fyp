Research on the practical realisation of quantum computing and quantum information science is proceeding expeditiously. Presented in this work is an approach using quantum dots (QDs) as a photonic qubit source. Quantum dots are commonly referred to as "artificial atoms" due to their discrete energy levels and few carrier confinement. They allow on demand qubits and compatible with semiconductor foundry technologies. An inexpensive solid state device capable of generating single and entangled qubits on demand would be a great asset in exploring practical quantum technologies. 

In practice the barrier to perfect entangled photon emission is the fine structure splitting (FSS) and decoherence. In this report it is verified that all photon pairs emitted from the biexciton cascade are entangled. However a time dependent phase when the FSS is non-zero causes the measured ensemble to be made of non-identical pairs, and thus the results can look non-entangled. 

In this report is a detailed study on a charged biexciton species observed in the entangled photon emitting QDs is also presented. This specific species is a good indicator that the QD is an entangled photon emitter. A theoretical fine structure is presented supported by correlation measurements and a rate equation model.
